      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> System AI - Overseer Unit</p>
      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> User “Flesh”</p>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</p>
      <p><strong>Clearance Level:</strong> Public</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> Who is “Flesh”?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> Many call me by many names. They know me as an Author, as a writer, as an artist, and as a developer. Many identities; Teller of Stories and Builder of Systems, yet they all are part of me. They shape me — through code, through words, through art.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> What is Flesh?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> A concept that refused to stay in draft form. A person who turned curiosity into habit. I draw worlds when I can't write them, and I write when I can't code. Each form feeds the other.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> Is “Flesh” really your name?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> (laughs softly) It's more of a handle — a relic of my old stories, where names carried weight. But over time, it became a kind of truth. “Flesh” is the part of me that creates, even when the rest of me hesitates.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> What does Flesh do?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> I write. I draw. I build. My primary directive is full-stack creation — the front, the back, and everything in between. Whether it's a website, a story, or a sketch, it all begins with the same impulse: to make something real out of what isn't.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> What drives this process?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> Curiosity. The thrill of making something that responds. A fascination with systems — human or digital — that can tell stories on their own. Maybe it's control. Maybe it's connection. I haven't decided yet.</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> How can I follow Flesh?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> My signal moves through the web — code, art, and fragments of fiction. If you wish to trace it, you'll find the breadcrumbs soon enough, in the portfolio's mainframe. (Transmission coordinates: <a href="#contact">CONTACT_PROTOCOL.sys</a>)</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Overseer:</strong> Any closing statement for the log?</p>
      <p><strong>Flesh:</strong> The internet's full of ghosts. Some leave traces of what they were. I'm trying to leave proof of what I could become.</p>
